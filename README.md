# Minus World MyBB

[Minus World](https://minus.world/) is a website that currently runs off of a modified [MyBB](https://mybb.com/) forum.

At the moment can't open source the code because we have our code based on a premium theme, [Respond](https://community.mybb.com/showthread.php?tid=172197).

The Github repo is open so we can track issues out in the wild.
